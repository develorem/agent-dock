## What is Agent Dock?

Agent Dock is a free, open-source desktop app for developers who use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) across multiple projects. Instead of juggling separate terminal windows, Agent Dock puts every session in one place — with a file explorer, git status, file preview, and AI chat panel for each project.

Switch between projects with a single click. See at a glance which sessions are working, which are waiting for input, and which are idle.

## Features

### Multi-Project Workspaces

Open as many project folders as you need, each in its own tab. Every tab gets a fully independent workspace — rearrange panels, float them, or tab them together however you like.

### AI Chat Panel

A terminal-style interface for interacting with Claude Code. Messages stream in real-time, past conversation history collapses to keep things tidy, and permission prompts appear inline — no disruptive pop-ups.

### File Explorer

A read-only tree view of your project that respects `.gitignore`. Click any file to preview it instantly.

### Git Status

See staged and unstaged changes at a glance with color-coded indicators. Click a changed file to view its diff in the preview panel.

### File Preview

Syntax-highlighted code for dozens of languages, rendered markdown, image previews, and inline diffs — all without leaving Agent Dock.

### Toolbar Status Icons

Each project tab in the toolbar shows Claude's current state: idle, working, or waiting for input. A red badge warns you when a session is running in dangerous mode.

### Themes

Six built-in themes — choose between light and dark variants to match your preferences. Every panel, including the AI chat, respects the active theme.

### Workspace Save & Load

Save your entire session — open projects, panel layouts, toolbar position, theme — and restore it later. Recent workspaces are a click away from the File menu.
