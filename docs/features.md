Agent Dock gives you a single window to manage AI coding sessions across all your projects. Here's what's included.

## Multi-Project Workspaces

Open as many project folders as you need, each in its own tab. Save your entire session — open projects, panel layouts, toolbar position, theme — and restore it later.

## Project Tabs & Settings

Each project appears as a tab in the toolbar with a status icon showing the agent's current state. Customize projects with icons, colors, and descriptions. Drag tabs to reorder them.

## AI Chat Panel

A terminal-style interface for interacting with your AI agent. Messages stream in real-time, past conversation history collapses to keep things tidy, and permission prompts appear inline — no pop-ups.

## File Explorer

A read-only tree view of your project that respects `.gitignore`. Click any file to preview it instantly. Open files in VS Code, Windows Explorer, or a terminal from the toolbar.

## Git Status

See staged and unstaged changes at a glance with color-coded indicators. Click a changed file to view its diff. Switch branches or create new ones from the branch picker.

## File Preview

Syntax-highlighted code for dozens of languages, rendered markdown with heading sizes and formatting, image previews, and inline diffs — all without leaving Agent Dock.

## Themes

Six built-in themes — three dark (Obsidian, Midnight, Ember) and three light (Frost, Parchment, Sakura). Every panel respects the active theme.

Change your theme from **Settings > Theme**.
