# v0.6.0

## Branch Switcher

Added a branch picker to the Git Status panel. Click the "..." button next to the branch name to open a popup with:

- **Filter textbox** — type to filter existing local branches with autocomplete
- **Branch list** — shows all matching branches with a checkmark on the current branch; double-click or press Enter to switch
- **Create new branch** — when the typed name doesn't match any existing branch, a "+" button appears to create and switch to a new branch

Keyboard shortcuts: Down arrow moves to the list, Enter selects/creates, Escape closes the popup.

## Open Logs Folder

Added **Settings > Open Logs Folder** menu item. Clicking it opens Windows Explorer to the logs directory, making it easy to find and share log files.

## Markdown Heading Sizes

Fixed markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) all rendering at the same font size in both the file preview panel and AI chat markdown view. Headings now render at distinct sizes matching their level.

## Documentation Overhaul

Reorganized documentation into dedicated pages by topic:

- **[Features](../features.md)** — feature overview with links to detailed docs
- **[Workspace](../workspace.md)** — saving, loading, themes, and settings
- **[Projects](../projects.md)** — tabs, project settings, and panel layouts
- **[Project Features](../project-features.md)** — File Explorer, Git Status, and File Preview
- **[AI Chat](../ai-chat.md)** — sessions, message types, and troubleshooting

INSTALL.md slimmed down to installation and quick start, with links to the new docs.
