# v0.6.0

## Branch Switcher

Added a branch picker to the Git Status panel. Click the "..." button next to the branch name to open a popup with:

- **Filter textbox** — type to filter existing local branches with autocomplete
- **Branch list** — shows all matching branches with a checkmark on the current branch; double-click or press Enter to switch
- **Create new branch** — when the typed name doesn't match any existing branch, a "+" button appears to create and switch to a new branch

Keyboard shortcuts: Down arrow moves to the list, Enter selects/creates, Escape closes the popup.

## Open Logs Folder

Added **Settings > Open Logs Folder** menu item. Clicking it opens Windows Explorer to the logs directory, making it easy to find and share log files.

## Markdown Heading Sizes

Fixed markdown headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) all rendering at the same font size in both the file preview panel and AI chat markdown view. Headings now render at distinct sizes matching their level.
